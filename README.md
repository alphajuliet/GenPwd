__GenPwd__ is a simple password generator that runs in a single-page HTML application. Using combinations of weighted letters and vowels it generates pseudo-English words. It offers options for additional complexity through numbers, punctuation, and capitals.

There are two generators available:
* _generator1_: vaguely reminiscent of English
* _generator2_: probably offensive to Japanese

# Caveats

1. The generated passwords are not guaranteed or even designed to be uniformly distributed throughout the target space. They should not be used for systems that require strong password authentication. Use at your own risk.

2. Randomly generated words may turn out to be offensive in some languages. If you're offended by something in the list, try again.

# Development
